							<h1>Rebuilds & Restorations</h1>
							<p>We specialise in rebuilds and full restorations at West Wales Defender, and typically have 2-3 rebuilds in progress at any one time. Our next restoration slot (as of Aug 2025) is <i>early 2026</i> (please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> for details).</p>
							<p>We've put together this page to explain a bit about our processes, outline the possibilities when rebuilding, and make restoring your Defender as simple and enjoyable as possible</p>
							<p>Restorations typically take anywhere from 7 months to 2 years, (mainly depending on wait times for parts etc).</p></p>

											<h3>Trusted Restorations</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>We provide regular updates via WhatsApp and photo galleries <a href="#explainer">(some examples here)</a>, and keep you involved and informed at every stage of the process. With Land Rovers often passed down through generations, we recognise how important a restoration can be, and you'll be in the right hands with us.</p>
										</div>
									</section>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3>Pricing</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p><i>"How much?"</i> is the most important question, and one we hear often! The answer is - <i>it depends</i>!</p>
											<p>We have fixed prices and set labour rates for as many jobs as we can, and we'll tell you what might be variable - up front. Most other restorers won't tell you, or will split out costs - but we believe with such an important project, you should be in control.</p>
											<p>We only charge for labour, and don't make profit on parts - we'll even tell you which parts are needed, so you can source and send direct to us. We'll let you know when a range of options are available - and what might be a good idea (or not!).</p>
											<p>We also provide an assessment service - we'll professionally assess your Defender and let you know what we recommend doing - with various options for parts/prices. This is free when you take a restoration, and £150 as a standalone service.</p>
											<p>You should budget between £20k and £50k for a restoration, depending on what you want done, and the starting condition of your Defender. For example, prices vary on parts (OEM, genuine, modified, etc), so this should be taken into account.</p>
											<p>Our restored vehicles have typically been insured for a value of between £40-100k after full restoration - examples in <a href="#explainer">our photo galleries here</a>.</p>

											<h3>Rolling Chassis Options</h3>
										</header>
										<div class="content">
											<p>During the restoration process, we will get your Defender down to a 'rolling chassis'. Without doubt - <i>this is the best time to upgrade loads of bits</i> - and you'll save money doing it at this time, whilst it's apart and things are easy to change. Full details <a href="#rollingchassis">below</a>.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Vision</h2>
							<p>We can bring your Defender back to 'factory fresh' or transform it - we even do conversions to/from pickup, station wagon, soft-top, and panel van - adding or removing windows or cab options. As they say - <i>it's your party</i> - so let us know what you're looking for, and we can bring it to life. At this stage, we can talk through options with you, and plan the restoration.</p>

					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="stripdown">
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Strip Down</h2>
							<p>For all our restorations, we will do a 'nut and bolt' strip-down of your Land Rover (part of our fixed rebuild price). At this stage, we find out (deep breath) everything about your vehicle:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>which panels which will need repairing or replacing due to corrosion/now being basically almost all body filler</li>
								<li>running gear - we find out what will need replacing</li>
								<li>complete strip-down of axles</li>
								<li>wiring harnesses assessments</li>
								<li>everything washed - getting rid of years worth of grime and oil</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We then make up a parts list for your vehicle of things which need replacing - we usually recommend quality aftermarket alternatives - galvalised/strengthened when possible, so you'll have a vehicle which doesn't rot!</p>

					<section class="spotlight style1 orient-right content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in" id="axles">
						<div class="content">
							<h2>Axles</h2>
							<p>Depending on the condition of your axles, we can repair or full restore - with a full restoration (parts included) costing about £4500+VAT. With a full restoration, we do the following:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>sand blast & powder coat everything, including hubs</li>
								<li>new oil seals and gaskets</li>
								<li>new (heavy duty) solid half shafts</li>
								<li>swivels if needed inc. oil seals</li>
								<li>stainless YRM brackets</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We also provide options to upgrade from drum to disk brakes</p>

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Engine, Clutch, Gear Box, & Transfer Box</h2>
							<p>We start with a steam clean, and go from there - usually repainting the engine (in factory colour, or whatever you like). Depending on the condition of your engine (we find most are fairly good), we do a full service by a qualified ex-Land Rover technician (~£185+VAT) or rebuild with skim/rebore/gaskets for around £1800+VAT.</p>
							<p>At this stage, we look at the clutch, gear box, and transfer box. We offer approved partner upgrades to LOF Clutches (3 types depending on intended usage). At this point, we can configure other options, such as:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>new pipes, silicon hoses</li>
								<li>engine and axle breather kits for wading (fixed price)</li>
								<li>stainless steel brake and clutch lines (with colour options!) from our partners at Pioneer 4x4</li>
								<li>airbox upgrades for Puma Defenders</li>
								<li>gearbox and transfer box repairs/upgrades from Winchester Gears</li>

							<h2>Rolling Chassis</h2>
							<p>Time to put the running gear together. At this stage, we build your chassis with all-new stainless steel fixings and brackets, and fire up the engine. At this stage, we can also do fixed-price additions and upgrades on:</p>
							<ul>
							<li>suspension</li>
							<li>brakes</li>

							<li>wheels and tyres (standard or adapt for bigger)</li>
							<li>transfer box (with options to change ratios for better speed/smoothness/MPG)</li>
